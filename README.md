# Random-moving-pixel

My first C++ program.
It prints a pixel at a random position and random colour

There are 2 variants C++ and Python

## The way it moves:

it start at **x** = 0 and **y** = 0

then it adds to **x** and **y** a random number integer from -1 to 1


to avoid errors it will detect when the **x** is smaller than 0 it will add ___width___ to **x**. Or if it is bigger than the (___width___ - 1) it will subtract the ___width___. And **y** is the same as **x** but replaces ___width___ with ___height___

### Python
In python version it a bit more complicated because i use multithread to make it a bit faster and able to run multiple at same time

## Program Location
C++:randpxl\x64\Debug

Python:\

<sup>I made this before using TI-BASIC in TI-84 Plus CE and Python</sup>
